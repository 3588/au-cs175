<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">Enjoying a longstanding peace in politics and 
economic prosperity, the Chinese Song Dynasty (960AD-1279AD) was a marvelous 
period during which many cultural traditions flourished. Tea-drinking, for 
example, became very popular at that time. Since the good government of that 
time called for more civil officials than brave generals, intellectuals were 
highly valued, and what the intellectuals treasured was an elegant way of 
living. Even when they were holding a competition, they pursued it in a genteel 
way. The ancient custom of the ¡°Tea Fight¡± is a case in point.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">The ¡°Tea Fight¡± custom, according to research, 
originated in Jian¡¯an County, Fujian Province, where White Tea is harvested. In 
those days, when fresh tea had been picked and processed in late spring, each 
tea farmer would bring out his crop to fight for the honor of presenting his own 
tea to the emperor as a tribute. Later, the convention was borrowed and carried 
forward by the tea¡¯s customers, including plain intellectuals, courtier 
officials, and even the emperors. When having a get-together, they were all fond 
of the competition to make good tea, and this tradition came to be called ¡°tea 
fights¡±.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">Litterateurs have written many works to record 
the theory and fun of the tea fight. According to their depiction, participants 
in the fight have to go through five processes before they present their tea for 
judgment: choosing the tea cake, grinding the tea, boiling the water, churning 
the cream, and infusing the tea while stirring.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">To choose a fine tea cake is the sine qua non 
of making good tea. Usually, competitors will adopt a kind of semi-fermented 
cake made of white tea. The Emperor Huizong of Song put forward three criteria 
for a fine tea cake: in color, the cakes should look pure instead of mottled; in 
texture, they should be hard; and when broken, they should make a ¡°crack¡± sound.</p>
