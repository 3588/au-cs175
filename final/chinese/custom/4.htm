<p style="text-indent: -1.5pt; margin: 0px 3px 15px;">In ancient times, because 
of inconvenient mode of transportations-often by land or water- and an 
increasing trade between regions, bodyguard agencies were formed in order to 
ensure the security of travel and also the safe delivery of goods.</p>

different places connect with each other and some of them even had their own 
branches in other places which made the service of remittance possible. In the 
late Ming Dynasty(1368-1644) and early Qing Dynasty(1636-1911), bodyguard 
agencies were even in charge of shipping a soldier¡¯s pay for the government. 
Later, they also guarded houses and money transfer firms. It is said that even 
Li Hongzhang¡¯s house was protected by the most famous bodyguard agency of 
Beijing, Huiyou Bodyguard Agency. In the mid Qing Dynasty, bodyguard agencies 
began to escort silver for money transfer firms. In the late Qing Dynasty, as 
businesses for agencies declined, their main services also changed. They began 
to escort clothes, goods and precious accessories for rich and powerful people 
as well as ensuring their personal security. Three other escort sorts of 
services which took place since then were food, goods and human.</p>

special industry. In Kungfu novels, they are usually described as people who 
belong to certain Kungfu groups. Although in actual fact, bodyguard agencies are 
linked with local heroes who dwell in the jungle and the government agencies. 
Before starting such an agency, presents have to be given to both government 
officials and non-government officials alike. These people are then invited to 
the opening ceremony which was called Liangbiao It is their support given at the 
opening ceremonies which open the doors for business. The whole setup could be 
destroyed if any trouble was caused at the ceremony. A good ¡°Liangbiao¡± ensures 
the agency a foothold in the business; however, whether the agency can stand 
above others relies on how it carries out its first job.</p>
