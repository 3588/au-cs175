<p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0px 3px 15px;">A bodyguard agency includes a 
master, a chief guard, a manager and many guards who engage in protecting and 
other men carrying out chores. . The master, who is rich and powerful, usually 
has a wide network connection. Should a problem arise, the master would be able 
to solve it by counting on his networks by providing a solution. He should also 
be rich enough to compensate anyone should they have the valuable cargoes be 
looted. The manager should be keen, observant and careful, with an eye for 
detail. The chief guard should be well-known for his excellent kungfu skills.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.8pt; margin: 0px 3px 15px;">These bodyguard agencies 
usually have their own words for describing things, which are known as ¡°Chun 
dian words¡±. These words, although are not elegant, are very practical. If used 
in the right manner, would help someone make friends, but if used in a wrong 
context, it will stir troubles and even battles. The guards are usually called 
¡°Chang xi de¡±( ¡°opera singers¡±) and the agency¡¯s flag as ¡°Yan¡±(¡°eyes¡±). There 
are many other ¡°Chun dian words¡±, for example a person is known as ¡°Liuding¡±, a 
half-open door is known as ¡°Ye shan ma san¡±, temple as ¡°Shen tang¡±, sunny days 
as ¡°Tian gao¡±, nights as ¡°Ming lu¡±, walking away as ¡°Bu chang¡±, the top of a 
wall as ¡°Ma¡± (it means horse), thief as ¡°Mang gu¡±, a bold man as ¡°Dian cu¡±, a 
coward as ¡°Dian xi¡± and rich as ¡°Hai la¡± and so on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.8pt; margin: 0px 3px 15px;">Simply stating, these old 
bodyguard agencies are quite similar to the present logistics companies. They 
all transport goods for others. Therefore, the bodyguard agencies which started 
in the late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty can be considered as the 
earliest logistics company in the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.8pt; margin: 0px 3px 15px;">The cargo transporting 
function of bodyguard agencies has been developed into modern logistics. But 
transportations of cargo goods have since changed. In ancient times, they 
transport only valuable goods. In order to protect those valuable goods, they 
need people who know are skilled in the art of kungfu.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5pt; margin: 0px 3px 15px;">However, in this modern 
day, a driver¡¯s license is all that¡¯s needed for people work in the logistics 
industry.</p>
