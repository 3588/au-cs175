<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">When a qualified cake has been chosen, it 
should be grinded. The tea maker wraps a small piece of the cake in a paper bag 
and grinds it with an edge runner. But this is not enough. Using a sieve, the 
maker also has to sieve out coarse particles. After this process, only a fine 
tea powder remains.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">The third step is to boil the water. The ware 
that people of the Song Dynasty used for boiling was usually a narrow-necked 
kettle, which enabled them to judge the temperature of the water according to 
its sound. After the water is boiled, it is poured into a wide-mouthed clay jar 
for later use.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">To make the cream is the fourth process of the 
preparation. Some tea powders need to be ladled out, and then mixed with a small 
quantity of water. The more viscous the cream is, the better the tea will be.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">Then the most important job comes¡ªthe tea 
fighter has to infuse water into the teacup of cream and stir the solution at 
just the right speed. The water must come out smooth and steady, and the 
stirring has to be coordinated well with the pouring to produce a full 
dissolution.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">Then what is the standard for good tea? That is 
to say, what makes a winner in a tea fight?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">Firstly, good tea should look good in color. 
For White Tea, for example, the best color of the tea would be milky white. A 
milky green color indicates that the tea is undercooked, and milky grey or milky 
yellow would be even worse.</p>
