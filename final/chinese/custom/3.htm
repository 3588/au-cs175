the foam that comes out after the tea is stirred. The foam of well-made tea will 
not disappear very soon, so the duration of the foam is an important standard 
with which to identify a good cup of tea. While the foam is still covering the 
liquid, the best state is to form a smooth and even quilt, just like the surface 
of a bowl of cold porridge.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">To win the challenge, a good tea fighter will 
use special water and a rare tea cup, as well as a fine tea cake and his great 
skills. Black pottery cups are highly recommended in the competition, because 
the black and white contrast between the cup and the tea will be very pleasant 
to the eyes. A type of tea container called Tuhao Cups (cups with hare몶s fur 
glaze) is said to be a valued ware in tea fighting, since the manufacturing 
process of them is rather complicated.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 3px 15px;">The Song Dynasty witnessed the heyday of the 
tea fights, but thereafter the custom waned. Japanese visitors, however, brought 
the art of the tea fight to their own country, and carried it forward into Sado, 
that is, the art of tea making. In fact, the spirit of the tea fight still 
exists in China. It comes out when people, in and out of the lands of 
tea-production, taste different teas and decide on a champion. Tea is an herb 
rich with cultural significance, embodying the philosophy of tranquility and 
elegance that the Chinese people have pursued throughout the history. Actually, 
the tea fight is not a fight; it is a romantic way of appreciating tea and life 
itself. Time flies and steam flows, but Chinese people몶s musing on tea and 
attitude toward life will last forever.</p>
